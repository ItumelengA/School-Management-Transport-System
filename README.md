# 🚌 School Transport Management System (STMS)

## 📘 Overview

The **School Transport Management System (STMS)** is a desktop-based solution developed using **Java (NetBeans)** to improve the management, safety, and efficiency of school transportation. It ensures that students are transported safely from home to school and back, while providing transparency and reliability for parents, schools, and transport service providers.

STMS introduces **automated scheduling**, **digital record keeping**, and **real-time communication mechanisms** to modernize traditional school transport operations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure **safe and reliable** transportation for students.  
- Improve **communication** between parents, drivers, and school management.  
- Automate **data entry**, **payment tracking**, and **driver verification**.  
- Enhance **accountability** and **record management** for all stakeholders.

## ⚠️ Problem Identification

### 1. No Parental Communication
Parents are not updated about transport changes or their child’s location, causing misunderstandings and safety concerns.

### 2. No Real-Time Monitoring
Parents and schools cannot track where the transport vehicle is during trips.

### 3. Poor Synchronization and Organization
Transport timing and routes are hard to manage manually, resulting in missed pickups and delays.

### 4. Manual Driver and Student Records
Hardcopy documents get lost or mixed up, making it difficult to manage drivers, learners, and payment data.

### 5. Difficulty Identifying Learners
Drivers often struggle to recognize students, increasing the risk of errors or safety issues.

### 6. Lack of Verification
Drivers and vehicles are sometimes unverified, posing safety risks for students.

## 💼 Daily Transactions in School Transport

| Process | Description | Problems Identified |
|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Pickup** | Drivers collect learners from home. | No confirmation to parents that students are safely on board. |
| **Drop-offs** | Learners dropped at school or home. | Parents receive no updates on arrival. |
| **Afternoon Return** | Learners picked up from school. | Miscommunication due to schedule changes. |
| **Fee Collection** | Manual cash payments. | Lost records, unpaid balances, and disputes. |
| **Driver Verification** | Drivers hired without verification. | Unsafe and unregulated drivers on duty. |
